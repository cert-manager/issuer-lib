# cert-manager issuer-lib

> issuer-lib is the Go library for building cert-manager issuers.

## Stability disclaimer

⚠️ Warning: This library's API is still subject to change. Developers using this library will have to update their
code when updating to a newer version.

0. Currently, this library is used to build production Issuers, but no open-source Issuers/ examples are available yet. We advise to use this library only for experimentation.
1. Once we have an open-source Issuer
that uses this library & we have an example project that shows how to use this library, we will start advising developers to build all new issuers on top of this library.
2. Once we have a 2nd or 3rd open-source Issuer that uses this library, we should be able to guarantee more stability.
At this point, we will start advising developers to migrate their existing Issuers to this library.
3. At 5+ open-source Issuers, we plan to make a stable v1 release of this library.

## Introduction

cert-manager issuers are responsible for watching CertificateRequest resources and updating
their status with the signed certificate data. An issuer must only respond to
CertificateRequests that have an IssuerRef that matches the Name, Kind and group
of one of its Issuer resources. Additionally, the CertificateRequest must have been approved.

This library provides all the controllers necessary to implement a cert-manager
issuer, these controllers contain all the common logic required to implement
an issuer. The only thing you need to provide is the business logic for
communicating with your CA, this is done by implementing the `Sign` and `Check`
functions.

## Goals

This library makes it easy to create a cert-manager issuer that integrates with
your CA.

It takes care of:

- Watching CertificateRequests and your custom Issuer resources
- Updating the Issuer status with status of the CA
- Updating the CertificateRequest status with the signed certificate data
- Handling errors and retries
- Handling CertificateRequest approval and denial
- Handling issuance of Kubernetes CSR resources
- [FUTURE] Provide a set of conformance tests for issuers

## Usage

An example issuer implementation can be found in the [`./examples/simple`](./examples/simple) subdirectory.

## Log levels

The library relies on the log levels defined in `logr`, i.e., numbers from 0 to
9\. You can use any logging library you like in your controller as long as the
levels "match". The two only logr levels used in issuer-lib are 0 ("info") and 1
("debug").

For example, the message "Succeeded signing the CertificateRequest" is logged at
the level 0 ("info"). To integrate well with issuer-lib, your controller should
also use the level 0 when logging messages that inform the user about changes to
the CertificateRequest.

## How it works

This repository provides a go libary that you can use for creating cert-manager controllers for your own Issuers.

To use the libary, your Issuer API types have to implement the `v1alpha1.Issuer` interface.
The business logic of the controllers can be provided to the libary through the `Check` and `Sign` functions.
- The `Check` function is used by the Issuer controllers.  
If it returns a normal error, the controller will retry with backoff until the `Check` function succeeds.  
If the error is of type `signer.PermanentError`, the controller will not retry automatically. Instead, an increase in Generation is required to recheck the issuer.

- The `Sign` function is used by the CertificateRequest controller.  
If it returns a normal error, the `Sign` function will be retried as long as we have not spent more than the configured `MaxRetryDuration` after the certificate request was created.  
If the error is of type `signer.IssuerError`, the error is an error that should be set on the issuer instead of the CertificateRequest.  
If the error is of type `signer.PermanentError`, the controller will not retry automatically. Instead, a new CertificateRequest has to be created.

## Reconciliation loops

The reconciliation function of the CertificateRequest controller will:
1. wait for the request to be Approved/ Denied
2. only consider the configured Issuer API types
3. leave Ready/ Failed/ Denied CertificateRequests as-is
4. start by setting the Ready condition to Initializing
5. set the Ready condition to Denied if the CertificateRequest is denied
6. wait for the linked Issuer to exist and be in an up-to-date Ready state
7. call the `Sign` function and handle errors as described above
8. update the CertificateRequest with the returned Signed Certificate and set the state to Ready

The reconciliation function of the Issuer controllers will:
1. only reconcile if the Ready condition is not "failed permanently" or the CertificateRequest controller notified that the Ready condition is no longer valid
2. if the issuer status is Ready and we received an issuer error from the CertificateRequest controller, set the Ready condition to false and set the error
3. start by setting the Ready condition to Initializing
4. call the `Check` function and handle errors as described above
5. update the Issuer by setting the state to Ready

Note that a reconciliation will only be triggered:
- for CertificateRequests:
    - on create
    - on update when an annotation is changed/ added or removed
    - on update when a condition is added or removed
    - on update when a non-readiness condition is changed
    - on update when the Ready condition of the linked Issuer is changed/ added or removed
    - when triggered in the previous reconciliation

- for Issuers:
    - on create
    - on update when an annotation is changed/ added or removed
    - on update when the generation (.Spec) changes
    - on update when the Ready condition was added/ removed
    - when triggered in the previous reconciliation
