// discouraged, instead the CA should be provisioned separately (e.g. using trust-manager).

// resource. This interface hides the spec fields of the underlying resource
// and exposes a Certificate template and the raw CSR bytes instead. This
// allows the signer to be agnostic of the underlying resource type and also
// agnostic of the way the spec fields should be interpreted, such as the
// defaulting logic that is applied to it. It is still possible to access the
// labels and annotations of the underlying resource or any other metadata
// fields that might be useful to the signer. Also, the signer can use the
// GetConditions method to retrieve the conditions of the underlying resource.
// To update the conditions, the special error "SetCertificateRequestConditionError"
// can be returned from the Sign method.
